After an 11 year career in the sports and entertainment industry, I decided to dive into a new opportunity.  The idea of meeting a customer and finding the perfect gift for that special occasion is pretty amazing.  I am fortunate to occupy a space that has housed a retail store since the late 80’s.  I am forever grateful to those who came before me and allowed this local business to thrive.  Over the years, the various stores at 132 North Street  have evolved to meet the demands and needs of the local customers.  I am excited to keep the products that the town has come to love over the years as well as add a new funky twist to the boutique.  I couldn’t be happier that you love our products as much as I do and I am forever grateful for the opportunity to share a few of my favorite things with you.\"",

The wood church, 128 feet high and with an interior of chestnut capped with black walnut, was built on the site of the oldest house in Hingham, which had been demolished in 1866.  In 1988, after a six-year study of more than 1,100 parishes throughout the United States, a pastoral institute at Notre Dame chose St. Paul's Church to be featured in the video, \"The Dynamic Parish.\" Churches that were deemed \"dynamic\" were community oriented churches where parishioners socialized and found spiritual enrichment and emotional support during crises. The sense of community was primarily created by St. Paul's school and its \"involved\" parent/teacher organization. The 30-minute video will be used in adult education classes to provide a diversity of leadership approaches for churches throughout the country.",

    "notes":"History of New North Church  In 1805, there was only one meeting house in North Hingham, called First Parish in Hingham , now known as Old Ship Church or the Old Ship Meetinghouse. Following the resignation of the incumbent minister, a schism developed over the choice of a successor. Four deacons and a number of members of the church, followed by a substantial minority of the residents of the North Parish, withdrew from the old meeting house.  The dissident group held its worship services in the old Derby Academy building on Main Street while work began on a “new North meeting house” at the foot of Lincoln Street. The frame of the new structure was completed on October 25, 1806 and the finished sanctuary was dedicated on June 17, 1807. The building design has long been credited to Charles Bulfinch, architect of the State House in Boston and other memorable buildings of the era. Whether or not Bulfinch actually drew up the plans, the building’s classic style clearly shows his influence.

I am a graduate of the Advanced Teacher Training Program  (950+ hours) from The Pilates Center of Boulder, Colorado (known as the “Harvard” of Pilates teacher training programs) and have a B.S. in Art with an emphasis in Painting from Elon University, NC. My students have been known to enjoy their homework illustrated with stick figures!  I’ve been practicing Pilates since 2003 and have taught Pilates since 2010. I opened my first studio location in Minneapolis, MN in 2014.  My students say I’m encouraging, relatable, goal oriented, committed, detailed, and celebrate their accomplishments. My goal as a Pilates instructor is to increase my student’s strength, stability, flexibility, and mobility all while having a good time! Pilates is for all ages and I encourage my students to embrace it as a practice. holly & olive: ",
