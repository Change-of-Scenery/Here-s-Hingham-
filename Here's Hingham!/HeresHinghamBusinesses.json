Four deacons and a number of members of the church, followed by a substantial minority of the residents of the North Parish, withdrew from the old meeting house.\n\nThe dissident group held its worship services in the old Derby Academy building on Main Street while work began on a ‚Äúnew North meeting house‚Äù at the foot of Lincoln Street. The frame of the new structure was completed on October 25, 1806 and the finished sanctuary was dedicated on June 17, 1807.
