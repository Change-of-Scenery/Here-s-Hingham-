Following the resignation of the incumbent minister, a schism developed over the choice of a successor. Four deacons and a number of members of the church, followed by a substantial minority of the residents of the North Parish, withdrew from the old meeting house.<br/><br/>The dissident group held its worship services in the old Derby Academy building on Main Street while work began on a “new North meeting house” at the foot of Lincoln Street. The frame of the new structure was completed on October 25, 1806 and the finished sanctuary was dedicated on June 17, 1807. The building design has long been credited to Charles Bulfinch, architect of the State House in Boston and other memorable buildings of the era. Whether or not Bulfinch actually drew up the plans, the building’s classic style clearly shows his influence.
