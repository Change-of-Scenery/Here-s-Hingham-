After an 11 year career in the sports and entertainment industry, I decided to dive into a new opportunity.  The idea of meeting a customer and finding the perfect gift for that special occasion is pretty amazing.  I am fortunate to occupy a space that has housed a retail store since the late 80’s.  I am forever grateful to those who came before me and allowed this local business to thrive.  Over the years, the various stores at 132 North Street  have evolved to meet the demands and needs of the local customers.  I am excited to keep the products that the town has come to love over the years as well as add a new funky twist to the boutique.  I couldn’t be happier that you love our products as much as I do and I am forever grateful for the opportunity to share a few of my favorite things with you.\"",

The wood church, 128 feet high and with an interior of chestnut capped with black walnut, was built on the site of the oldest house in Hingham, which had been demolished in 1866.  In 1988, after a six-year study of more than 1,100 parishes throughout the United States, a pastoral institute at Notre Dame chose St. Paul's Church to be featured in the video, \"The Dynamic Parish.\" Churches that were deemed \"dynamic\" were community oriented churches where parishioners socialized and found spiritual enrichment and emotional support during crises. The sense of community was primarily created by St. Paul's school and its \"involved\" parent/teacher organization. The 30-minute video will be used in adult education classes to provide a diversity of leadership approaches for churches throughout the country.",

    "notes":"History of New North Church  In 1805, there was only one meeting house in North Hingham, called First Parish in Hingham , now known as Old Ship Church or the Old Ship Meetinghouse. Following the resignation of the incumbent minister, a schism developed over the choice of a successor. Four deacons and a number of members of the church, followed by a substantial minority of the residents of the North Parish, withdrew from the old meeting house.  The dissident group held its worship services in the old Derby Academy building on Main Street while work began on a “new North meeting house” at the foot of Lincoln Street. The frame of the new structure was completed on October 25, 1806 and the finished sanctuary was dedicated on June 17, 1807. The building design has long been credited to Charles Bulfinch, architect of the State House in Boston and other memorable buildings of the era. Whether or not Bulfinch actually drew up the plans, the building’s classic style clearly shows his influence.

Jenn Weldon Pilates & Fitness  Hello there!  Thank you for taking the time to read my bio. I am a graduate of the Advanced Teacher Training Program  (950+ hours) from The Pilates Center of Boulder, Colorado (known as the “Harvard” of Pilates teacher training programs) and have a B.S. in Art with an emphasis in Painting from Elon University, NC. My students have been known to enjoy their homework illustrated with stick figures!  I’ve been practicing Pilates since 2003 and have taught Pilates since 2010. I opened my first studio location in Minneapolis, MN in 2014.  My students say I’m encouraging, relatable, goal oriented, committed, detailed, and celebrate their accomplishments. My goal as a Pilates instructor is to increase my student’s strength, stability, flexibility, and mobility all while having a good time! Pilates is for all ages and I encourage my students to embrace it as a practice. holly & olive: ",

Fearing's father, Hawkes Fearing, was the owner of the successful Hingham Cordage Company, located where Town Hall is today. Albert went into the maritime business, and made his fortune as a ship chandler in the port of Boston, selling all manner of ship supplies and fittings. In the 1850s he sold his business and retired to his Hingham home as a gentleman farmer. His house, built in 1640 and acquired by Fearing, later became St. Paul's Rectory, and his land extended north over the hill where Miles Road and Burditt Avenue are today, all the way to Broad Cove. Hence the origin of \"Fearing Road.\" He was a philanthropist and co-founded the Hingham Agricultural and Horticultural Society, dedicated to scientific principles in farming. In the late 1860s, Albert Fearing came up with his idea for a public library for the town.",

    "notes": "Date Built: Original home here was built in 1666 by Thomas Licoln the Cooper for his third son Benjamin Lincoln and his wife Sarah Fearing. Recent inspections by architectural historians suggest that nothing of the original structure is intact today, though there is evidence of resue of materials from the structure in the major additions of  1715 and 1790. Entrance enlarged in 1853.The house was originally a very modest dwelling, appropriate in scale and detail for a family making a living as a cooper and maltster. Thomas Lincoln (Benjamin's great, great grandfather) started the structure in 1637 and then a later structure, now the oldest two rooms in the house, the early kitchen and the \\\"borning\\\" room were built prior to 1667. These rooms are beautifully detailed with wainscoting and paneled walls and are kept as close to 'period correct' as possible - there is no electricity in the borning room!  Rose and Charles Woodard were presented the Bradford Sprout Award for Architectural Preservation at the 2010 Hingham Historical Society Annual Dinner. The Woodards are the 12th generation of Lincoln family descendants to live in the Benjamin Lincoln house . The house was named for the farmer and brewer who built it in the 1660s, but its most famous occupant was Benjamin Lincoln IV, a Revolutionary War hero appointed by General Washington to receive the British Army’s surrender at Yorktown in 1781.",

    "notes": "The 1752 Samuel Lincoln House is also sometimes called the Jonathan Hersey House and \"The Old Red House.\"\n\nBorn on 14 Feb 1714/5 in Hingham, Samuel Lincoln died in Hingham, on 10 Dec 1785; at age 71. Around 1742 Samuel first married Mary Bates. Born c. 1723, Mary died on 3 Jul 1763 in Hingham, at age 40. They had 2 children together. On 16 Oct 1763 when Samuel was 49, he second married Frances Jones. Born c. 1723, Frances died on 21 Jul 1781 in Hingham, MA.\n\n126 South Street was purchased by Samuel Lincoln. Jr. (1690/91-1758) around 1752. Samuel, a carpenter and sheriff, had previously built 170 North Street in 1721. Upon Samuel's death in 1758, his son, John Lincoln (1735-1811), a Revolutionary War captain, briefly held the property until 1761. Both Samuel and John Lincoln were descended from the first Samuel Lincoln (1622-1690) who came to Hingham in 1637.\n\nJedediah Beal (1688-1766) acquired 126 South Street in 1761 but died in 1766. His son, Jedediah (1717-1805), who fought in the Revolutionary War, only kept the property until 1768, when it appears he may have moved to Abington.\n\nIn 1768, 126 South Street was purchased by Ebed Hersey (1738/39-1836) and is one of the oldest Hingham houses associated with the Hersey family. Ebed is also associated with 120 and 122-24 South Street and there are other Hersey homes in the nearby area at 132, 139-41, 158-60 South Street and 2 South Lane. When known as the Jonathan Hersey House, the house references Ebed's son. Jonathan (b. 1764), a mariner who was lost at sea. All the Ebed Hersey family, which retained the property until the late 1860s, were descended from William Hersey (d. 1657-58), the original founder of the Hersey family in America. who emigrated from Berkshire, England, to Hingham in 1635.\n\nHingham homeopathic physician Henry Edwin Spalding (1843-1912). who fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg in 1862, owned 126 South Street from 1880 to 1897. The next owner was William Allen Vining (1839-1921), a foreman at the nearby Cushing House stables, and the property stayed in the family until 1929.\n\nThis early ridge and gambreled roof cottage has an interesting architectural history which has yet to be definitive. The Julian C. Loring records indicate that the cottage was built in the mid-eighteenth century, while visual evidence of the exterior and the interior, suggests that a late seventeenth century building date could be possible. The obvious exterior clue to an earlier date is the placement of the nine-over-nine sash windows, tightly under the eaves, and over the narrow cornice boards. This indicates the existence of very low rooms, typical of the late seventeenth century. The interior woodwork was examined by the late John Richardson who also concurred that this could be an earlier house. Originally, the house was a one-story residence with a ridge roof which became a gambreled roof when the loft above was extended to create two rooms above. Later, the top slope of the gambrel was elongated to the present roof configuration. The placement of the chimney, in the center of the slope of the top gambrel is another evidence.of the numerous alterations and enlargements undergone by the Samuel Lincoln House. One of the later additions is the fine enclosed pedimented entrance portico with sidelights framing the door. The Samuel Lincoln Jr. House is a fine reminder of South Street's early history.\n\nMuch of the above text is courtesy of Fannin/Lehner for the Hingham Historical Commission",

He married Bethia Lane (1680-1749.) They had 5 children. Weaver purchased 132 Main Street's land in 1700 from cordwainer Samuel Thaxter (1641-1725), this house lot having been part of the large Thaxter family holdings in Bachelor's Row. Thomas Thaxter (d. 1653-1654), one of Hingham's earliest settlers, purchased the lot in 1647, and after his death in 1654, it was inherited by his son, Samuel.\n\nThe Stodders were also an old Hingham family,. John Stodder (d.1661) arrived in Hingham in 1638. John was made a freeman in 1642 and by the time of his death had accumulated a substantial estate. Simon Stodder built his house c.1720, residing there until his death in 1757. The property was inherited by Simon's grandson, David Stodder (1748-1806), who willed it to his sister, Lydia Stodder (1750-1835), who lived out her life here.\n\nThe next family to own the house, for multiple generations, were the Seymours. Master carpenter and contractor Charles W. Seymour bought 132 Main Street from the Lydia Stodder Estate in 1836. Colonel Seymour, a selectman and highway surveyor, left both 132 and 136 Main Street in 1882 to his son, Charles W. S. Seymour (1839-1893), a civil engineer, and his two sisters. When Charles W. S. Seymour died in 1893, his share went to his wife, Martha A. Seymour. The 132 and 136 Main Street properties were divided in 1905 and 132 Main Street stayed with Martha A. Seymour, later inherited by her daughter, Harriet L. Soule. In 1938, Andrea Soule Wavle, granddaughter of Martha A. Seymour, came into possession of 132 Main Street and she was still in residence in 1972.",

    "notes": "Dr. Leavitt was for a number of years a practicing physician in Hingham.\n\nHe also was somewhat of a mechanical genius, and of an inventive turn of mind. Prior to the war of the Revolution he constructed a clock for the old meeting-house, \"the dial of which appeared in the dormer-window on the southwesterly slope of the roof, and was thus visible to the public.\"\n\nTradition says that he built a church organ and set it up in the old meeting-house, where it stood for a while, and that it was eventually sold to go to Portland, Me.\n\nI find no record, however, to verify this tradition; but that several years later he was a professional organ builder at Boston is certain.\n\nIn 1773 he built and resided in the house now owned and occupied by heirs of George Bassett on Main, corner of Elm Street.\n\nThis dwelling he sold in 1777 to Joseph Blake, and soon after removed to Boston. The Selectmen's Book of Records, Vol. II., show that as a physician he received a fair share of the patronage of the town, as no doubt he did from the public. His inventive perceptions, however, led him to seek other fields of employment. He was the son of Hezekiah and Grace (Hatch) Leavitt, and was born in Hingham Oct. 21, 1744. The Christian name of his wife was Azubah. She died at Boston Nov., 1803, aged 40 years. He died March, 1804, aged 59 years.\n\n\nThe Hingham Journal prints \"enlightening\" news about another owner of this house.\n\n\n<i>\"Mr. Geo. Bassett, the stable keeper has been shedding light upon his neighborhood by putting up the first street lamp in town. It is located on the corner of Main & Elm Streets & its brilliant beams shed a cheerful light which is see for quite a distance.\n\n\nWe learn that several residents are so well pleased with the project that they intend to follow his lead, & it is hoped that others will be inclined to extend a good work so nobly begun.\n\n\nWe understand that after the first outlay of putting up the arrangements, the expense of maintaining the light is but trifling. Every one, we think, will agree with us, that nothing looks more cheerful, or condues more to public safety than a street well lighted on a dark night.\"</i>\n\n\nAmong the owners of this house were Joseph Blake Jr. (1781), Joshua Barker (1790), George Bassett (1857), Heirs of George Bassett (1890), George P. Cushing (1904), Harriet A. Cushing (1931), Hingham Trust Company Trustees (1940), John T. & Lee M. Corwin (1962), Lee M. Corwin (1967), Robert L. Palmer (1974). \n",

    "notes": "The 1687 Samuel Hobart House: Choosing a site on an original 1635 grant of land to Edmund Hobart, Samuel Hobart (1645-1718), a \"yeoman\", built his Cape Cod home at 217 North Street in 1687. The location of the house, subsequently referred to as the \"paternal homestead\", on Hingham's oldest street (1635), was described in 1893 as \"North Street, near Hobart's Bridge.\" this being the bridge named for the Hobart family which spanned the now covered-over Town Brook just east of Thaxter Street between North and South Streets.\n\nSamuel Hobart and his family were descendants of Edmund Hobart (born c. 1570) who had come to Hingham, Massachusetts from Hingham, England, in 1633. Edmund's son was the well-known Reverend Peter Hobart (1604-1679), the first minister of the First Parish in Hingham. Upon Samuel's death in 1718, his son James (1689-1744), a constable in 1733, inherited the property. The house was shortly divided into a double residence as James was noted as residing \"on east part of the paternal homestead\", James' two sons, James (1727-1794) and John (1731-1791) each inherited one half of the property when he died in 1744. They each remained in residence until their respective deaths in 1791 and 1794. John, a farmer as well as a constable in 1760, 1766, and 1783, left his section of the house to his son, Shubal (1767-1800), a blacksmith. Following Shubal's death in 1800, his wife, Sabina, remained in residence until 1854, her death ending one hundred sixty-seven years of Hobart proprietorship. For the next thirty years there was a fairly regular turnover of ownership. In 1886, Charles Burke, a laborer, bought the property at public auction and the Burke family resided at 217 North Street until 1951. More recently, in 1982, the home was acquired by Alden and Blanche \"Becky\" Weston, (both since deseased) who began to restore it. Later the property was sold to Joyce Sullivan, who was the owner when the home was featured as part of a Hingham Historical Society house tour (Much of preceding text from a Minxie Fannin text for the Hingham Historical Commission.)\n\n More about Samuel Hobart's life: Samuel Hobart, son of Edmund, was born ~ 1645 in Charlestown and became known as a yeoman (owner of a small farm.) He married Hannah Gold in 1673, was the father of James Hobart. Their home on North Street was near what was called \"Hobart's Bridge.\" (A stream bed is still visible in this area today.) Died 1718 in Hingham.",

    "name": "Samuel Lincoln Jr.",
    "nickname": "",
    "notes": "The 1752 Samuel Lincoln House is also sometimes called the Jonathan Hersey House and \"The Old Red House.\"\n\nBorn on 14 Feb 1714/5 in Hingham, Samuel Lincoln died in Hingham, on 10 Dec 1785; at age 71. Around 1742 Samuel first married Mary Bates. Born c. 1723, Mary died on 3 Jul 1763 in Hingham, at age 40. They had 2 children together. On 16 Oct 1763 when Samuel was 49, he second married Frances Jones. Born c. 1723, Frances died on 21 Jul 1781 in Hingham, MA.\n\n126 South Street was purchased by Samuel Lincoln. Jr. (1690/91-1758) around 1752. Samuel, a carpenter and sheriff, had previously built 170 North Street in 1721. Upon Samuel's death in 1758, his son, John Lincoln (1735-1811), a Revolutionary War captain, briefly held the property until 1761. Both Samuel and John Lincoln were descended from the first Samuel Lincoln (1622-1690) who came to Hingham in 1637.\n\nJedediah Beal (1688-1766) acquired 126 South Street in 1761 but died in 1766. His son, Jedediah (1717-1805), who fought in the Revolutionary War, only kept the property until 1768, when it appears he may have moved to Abington.\n\nIn 1768, 126 South Street was purchased by Ebed Hersey (1738/39-1836) and is one of the oldest Hingham houses associated with the Hersey family. Ebed is also associated with 120 and 122-24 South Street and there are other Hersey homes in the nearby area at 132, 139-41, 158-60 South Street and 2 South Lane. When known as the Jonathan Hersey House, the house references Ebed's son. Jonathan (b. 1764), a mariner who was lost at sea. All the Ebed Hersey family, which retained the property until the late 1860s, were descended from William Hersey (d. 1657-58), the original founder of the Hersey family in America. who emigrated from Berkshire, England, to Hingham in 1635.\n\nHingham homeopathic physician Henry Edwin Spalding (1843-1912). who fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg in 1862, owned 126 South Street from 1880 to 1897. The next owner was William Allen Vining (1839-1921), a foreman at the nearby Cushing House stables, and the property stayed in the family until 1929.\n\nThis early ridge and gambreled roof cottage has an interesting architectural history which has yet to be definitive. The Julian C. Loring records indicate that the cottage was built in the mid-eighteenth century, while visual evidence of the exterior and the interior, suggests that a late seventeenth century building date could be possible. The obvious exterior clue to an earlier date is the placement of the nine-over-nine sash windows, tightly under the eaves, and over the narrow cornice boards. This indicates the existence of very low rooms, typical of the late seventeenth century. The interior woodwork was examined by the late John Richardson who also concurred that this could be an earlier house. Originally, the house was a one-story residence with a ridge roof which became a gambreled roof when the loft above was extended to create two rooms above. Later, the top slope of the gambrel was elongated to the present roof configuration. The placement of the chimney, in the center of the slope of the top gambrel is another evidence.of the numerous alterations and enlargements undergone by the Samuel Lincoln House. One of the later additions is the fine enclosed pedimented entrance portico with sidelights framing the door. The Samuel Lincoln Jr. House is a fine reminder of South Street's early history.\n\nMuch of the above text is courtesy of Fannin/Lehner for the Hingham Historical Commission",
