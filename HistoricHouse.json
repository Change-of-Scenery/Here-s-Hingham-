After an 11 year career in the sports and entertainment industry, I decided to dive into a new opportunity.  The idea of meeting a customer and finding the perfect gift for that special occasion is pretty amazing.<br/><br/>I am fortunate to occupy a space that has housed a retail store since the late 80’s.  I am forever grateful to those who came before me and allowed this local business to thrive.  Over the years, the various stores at 132 North Street  have evolved to meet the demands and needs of the local customers.  I am excited to keep the products that the town has come to love over the years as well as add a new funky twist to the boutique.  I couldn’t be happier that you love our products as much as I do and I am forever grateful for the opportunity to share a few of my favorite things with you.\"",

You know, the ones that wear well for years to come. Labels like Faherty, AGOLDE, and Nili Lotan are some of our favorites, but the list is long.

In 1936, the building was converted into a single screen motion picture house that still operates today. The Loring Hall cinema is currently run by the local Patriot Cinemas company.<br/><br/>\nThe facility was purchased by Philip Scott in February 1964. On June 17, 1981, The Hingham Historical Society presented the Scott family with an architectural recognition award for their effort to maintain the architectural heritage of the town.",

Following the resignation of the incumbent minister, a schism developed over the choice of a successor. Four deacons and a number of members of the church, followed by a substantial minority of the residents of the North Parish, withdrew from the old meeting house.<br/><br/>The dissident group held its worship services in the old Derby Academy building on Main Street while work began on a “new North meeting house” at the foot of Lincoln Street. The frame of the new structure was completed on October 25, 1806 and the finished sanctuary was dedicated on June 17, 1807. The building design has long been credited to Charles Bulfinch, architect of the State House in Boston and other memorable buildings of the era. Whether or not Bulfinch actually drew up the plans, the building’s classic style clearly shows his influence.

The sense of community was primarily created by St. Paul's school and its \"involved\" parent/teacher organization.
